You are an expert senior frontend engineer + product designer.
Build a complete, production-style Admin Panel WEB APP (frontend-only static demo) in ReactJS.
________________


✅ Styling & Branding Instructions (Light Admin Theme, Draft Hause Branding)
1) Visual goal
* Build Admin Panel in LIGHT theme only (no dark mode).
* The admin must still “feel like Draft Hause” using brand accents, but with:
   * white/off-white surfaces
   * clean borders
   * soft shadows
   * premium “architectural / interior design” vibe
* Avoid flashy gradients in admin. Keep it modern and calm.
2) Brand color palette (derived from your app UI)
Use these as the only brand colors:
Primary Brand Gold
* #DEAC6B (main CTA buttons, highlights, active states, key icons)
Group 1171275238
Deep Bronze (support)
   * #685841 (secondary accents, outlines, subtle headings, premium touches)
Group 1171275238
Deep Teal (support / status)
      * #0F4540 (links, “active/in-progress” states, subtle chips, some charts)
Group 1171275238
Neutral System (light admin base)
         * Background: #F7F7F5
         * Surface/Card: #FFFFFF
         * Border: #E7E3DD
         * Text primary: #1B1B1B
         * Text secondary: #5B5B5B
         * Muted/placeholder: #8C8C8C
Rule: Gold is the “signature”. Teal is “functional”. Bronze is “premium trim”. Neutrals do the heavy lifting.
________________
3) Typography
         * Use a clean UI font (system font or Inter).
         * Scale:
         * Page title: 22–26px semibold
         * Section title: 16–18px semibold
         * Body: 14–15px regular
         * Table meta: 12–13px
Spacing rule: generous whitespace, avoid cramped UI.
________________
4) Layout & surfaces
         * App background: #F7F7F5
         * Cards:
         * White background
         * Border #E7E3DD
         * 12–16px radius
         * Soft shadow (very subtle)
         * Sidebar:
         * White or slightly tinted (#FFFFFF or #FBFAF8)
         * Active item indicator uses Gold (#DEAC6B)
         * Topbar:
         * White surface with border bottom
________________
5) Buttons (very important)
Define consistent button styles:
Primary Button
         * Background: #DEAC6B
         * Text: near-black #1B1B1B
         * Hover: slightly darker gold (auto)
         * Used for: “Create Project”, “Approve”, “Import”, “Save”
Secondary Button
         * Background: transparent or white
         * Border: #DEAC6B
         * Text: #1B1B1B
         * Used for: “Compare”, “View”, “Open Viewer”
Tertiary / Ghost
         * Background: transparent
         * Text: #0F4540 (teal)
         * Used for: inline actions, filters
Destructive
         * Background: white
         * Border: light red
         * Text: red
         * Used for: delete, remove, deactivate
________________
6) Inputs, dropdowns, search bars
         * Input background: white
         * Border: #E7E3DD
         * Focus ring: #DEAC6B (gold) — subtle
         * Error state:
         * border red
         * helper text red
________________
7) Tables (admin-grade)
Tables must look premium and readable:
         * Header row: slightly tinted background (#FBFAF8)
         * Row hover: very subtle tint
         * Zebra rows optional but subtle
         * Column actions as kebab menu
         * Use status badges consistently (see below)
________________
8) Badges / Status colors (strict mapping)
Use consistent badge system:
         * Draft: neutral gray
         * In Progress: teal (#0F4540) with light teal background tint
         * Needs Review: gold (#DEAC6B) with light gold tint
         * Approved: green (neutral system green)
         * Archived: muted gray
         * Open comment: gold tint
         * Resolved comment: muted gray/green tint
Badges must be rounded pills, 12–13px text, not loud.
________________
9) Icons & imagery
         * Use outline icons (simple, premium).
         * Keep 3D viewer controls minimal and professional.
         * For placeholders (floor plan images, model thumbnails):
         * Use light neutral frames
         * Small “Draft Hause” brand mark watermark optional (subtle)
________________
10) Motion (micro-interactions)
         * Keep animations minimal:
         * hover transitions 150–200ms
         * modal fade/scale subtle
         * No bouncy animations.
________________
11) Accessibility & contrast
         * Ensure text contrast is strong on light background.
         * Gold is used for accents and CTA backgrounds; don’t use gold for long text paragraphs.
________________
12) Implementation requirement (so AI actually applies it)
Force the AI to implement styling via one consistent method:
         * Either Tailwind theme config OR CSS variables (choose one).
         * Must include a single source of truth:
         * theme.ts or styles/tokens.css
         * All components must use these tokens (no random hex scattered).
________________
Quick edits needed in your existing master prompt
In your “dummy data” section, remove these phrases (since you don’t want timers):
         * “timer logs”
         * “TimerSession”
         * “avg time per project”
         * “time logs” in reports
Everything else stays.
0) Core Rules (STRICT)
         1. Frontend only. No backend. No real API calls.
Use static dummy data + simulated async (setTimeout).

         2. Only ONE real role inside admin: Admin.
Designers and Clients are managed entities — not login roles inside admin.

         3. Include a Public-Facing Client Portal section inside the same React app.

         4. Build using:

            * React + TypeScript

            * React Router

            * React Hook Form + Zod/Yup validation

            * Clean folder architecture

            * Proper component structure

               5. Must be fully interactive:

                  * CRUD updates local state

                  * Confirm delete modals

                  * Search/filter/sort/pagination

                  * Toast notifications

                  * Loading states + skeletons

                  * No TODO placeholders

                     6. Must include realistic dummy data:

                        * 12 Clients

                        * 8–12 Designers

                        * 25 Projects

                        * 2–8 Versions per project

                        * 120+ Comments

                        * Approvals per version

                        * Activity logs

                        * Notifications

                           7. Do NOT implement:

                              * Clock-in/out

                              * Work sessions

                              * Timesheets

                              * Hour tracking

                              * Payroll metrics

                              * Utilization rates

                              * Any HR-style reporting

Keep the system operationally realistic but avoid enterprise employee tracking features.
